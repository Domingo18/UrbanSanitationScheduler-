# Urban Sanitation Scheduler
An iOS application that provides address-driven sanitation pickup schedules for residential properties. The app resolves user-entered addresses via NYC geospatial services, determines sanitation rules by district, and presents pickup schedules in a calendar-based interface with persistent storage. Designed to help residents understand when and how their waste is collected based on their exact address. By integrating geocoding APIs with sanitation service data, the app converts a free-form street address into actionable scheduling information.

The system emphasizes:

Accurate address normalization
District-based service resolution
Clear schedule visualization
Offline persistence of saved addresses

This is a personal project for understanding Swift fundamentals and expand on my current knowledege.
